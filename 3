# my fall
Remember how 2 days ago I had $40 well now it's 0.
No surprise there my emotions got the better of me.
Damn it! 
I have cursed all evening,  guess I have accepted my truth.
$90 invested $90 lost.
I know it looks bad. Trust me it's not. In this life one has 
to accept you are going to fail. That does not mean you give up.
I certainly won't. 
Just when I think I have my emotions under check then boom.
I have realized that the difference between making profit and loss
in forex is knowing when to walk away.
To be very honest I may have gotten a bit greedy.
Deserve to lose my hard earned money.
Very important lesson. Always have a stop loss and take profit.
You don't have to set in but have it. It is the game changer.
Knowing how much you are willing to lose and how much you can
take form any trade.
See you next month as I start again on my journey in forex.
Cheers.
