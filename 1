#my journey in forex trading
# NOTE 1 : 11/12/2020
Nothing comes easy in this life.
I consider myself a risk taker. To be honest I risk too much 
and I consider it a blessing in disguise.
My dream is to become a multi-millionaire and I know a salary 
will not get me there.
Path for me to try was investment. So with my December 2020 
savings of $100 I invested in fxpesa(an onlne broker).
Less than 2 weeks in and I have lost more than half my investment.
Nothing to worry about. Getting discontinued in campus taught me
a very important virtue: patience.
I may be wrong but using the practice account taught me very little,
but using my own money for the past two weeks has taught me more than 
I learnt in 6 months. When you lose your own money, you feel the pain
and controlling my emotions has been my most difficult barrier yet.
Hope to overcome this because I know to become an accomplished trader I 
need to put my emotions aside and be objective.
