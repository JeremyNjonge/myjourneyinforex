# Monday 14/12/2020
I don't trade on weekends since I only trade forex and the market is closed.
Ended last week on a losing streak. Bad week for me.

New week and I am really optimistic. Hope this is a recovery week.
Great lessons learned.
1. I have realised I am long trader.
   Will read and watch youtube videos on long term trading.
   
2. Set a high stop loss limit and a low take profit limit.

3. If the market is not moving as anticipated do not panic.
   (your life is worth more than money)
   
4. Limit open positions to equity available but not more than 5 
   open positions at a time.
   
5. Not to trade all pairs at the same time.
   ( 2 at a time preferrably 1)
   
   
Current equity: $ 40
